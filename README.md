This project proposed a novel joint similarity  non-negative matrix factorization (JSNMF) model to identify the imaging genetic association of tumor related to recurrence.

The code in this project will reproduce the results in our paper, "Joint similarity non-negative matrix factorization model for identifcation of recurrence-related association patterns in tumor". The code was implemented and tested using Matlab.

You can run it by the .zip archive named JSNMF. The JSNMF.zip contains the code and input files.

You can run the JSNMF model using main.m in the zip file.The input files include WSI.csv, gene.csv, pathway.csv, and the label information sarcoma_label.csv. The output is the decomposed W and three H matrices.

The three H matrices can be used to identify the significant features and select the appropriate co-modules.
